# Two-Layer-Neural-Networks-CIFAR10-Classification

This project, done for the UC Berkeley course (CS189: Machine Learning), aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the underlying principles of neural networks.

# Project decription

This project implements a basic neural network with forward propagation, backpropagation and gradient descent algorithm from scratch using pure Python with NumPy library.
- Complete implementation of forward and backward propagation processes
- Utilize gradient descent for parameter updates
- Testing the model effect using the base dataset (CIFAR10)

# Environment

Before running the code in this directory, please create a new `conda`
environment by running:
```sh
bash conda_create.sh
conda activate cs189
```
